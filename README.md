# Alfred Themes - Clean

I love [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/). It does so many things so well, but the default themes just weren't quite what I wanted. So, I created these two themes (really, just one theme in two sizes) to be, well, clean.

## Installation

First off, you need to have [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/) installed, along with the [Powerpack](http://www.alfredapp.com/powerpack/). Then, you can download the [latest release](https://github.com/molawson/alfred-themes/releases/latest) zip file, unzip it, and double click on the theme(s) you want to import.
